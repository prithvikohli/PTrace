Ray tracer I'm building in C++ to learn ray tracing and physically-based rendering. Currently implemented as a stochastic ray tracer, simulating diffuse, metallic and dielectric materials, also including a camera with adjustable position and focus. Planning to implement features such as bounding volumes and subsurface scattering, and eventually extend it into a bidirectional path tracer.

Books/websites I'm using to learn:
- [Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing Series](https://raytracing.github.io/)
- [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics](https://www.routledge.com/Fundamentals-of-Computer-Graphics/Marschner-Shirley/p/book/9781482229394)
- [Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation](http://www.pbr-book.org/)
